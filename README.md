# css-flag

So.. this is one more of my "Web development" course on App Brewery with Teacher Angela.
And, i really need to say it, THIS WAS DIFFICULT.
Maybe positioning elements and divs on css are that difficult, but this project took me 3 days to "finish it"..
So.. i've put into Quotes cause i almost did like it was supposted to.
Here you can see what this flag should be:

I really tried, and that's ok to not be 100% precise, it's like, i'm learning, right????
I'll create this repository to mark my progression on github, so, feel comfortable to comment something that i need to improve, or something related to it.
